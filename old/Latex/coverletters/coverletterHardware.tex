 Dear TNG Technology Consulting, \\

 \noindent I am Dirk Hornung, a recently graduated Ph.D. student at the
 institute of high energy physics of the Autonomous University of Barcelona with
 5+ years of experience in leading the technology in different Startups. Within
 my studies, I researched low-energy QCD and the determination of Standard Model
 parameters. I developed a C++ fitting routine to extract parameters of
 theoretical models out of CERN experimental data. \\

 \noindent Besides my studies, I am an entrepreneur. During the last year, I
 developed Smart Contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain and connected them through
 REST APIs using Node Express for a legaltech. Before I developed a chatbot
 using Artificial Intelligence for a fintech. We connected our clients through
 Messenger to their bank accounts and analyzed their banking information using
 Python. I am furthermore a Full-stack developer with lots of experience
 developing applications using React as frontend and AWS services as a backend.  \\

 \noindent Currently I am educating myself on Prototyping. I acquired a fully
 equipped lab with a 3D printer and a CNC machine to create PCB boards. I am
 gathering experience with electronic components and Fusion 360 while building
 different types of Home security IoT devices.\\

 \noindent Sincerely, \\
 Dr. Dirk Hornung \\

 \noindent P.S. I am a native German, but also fluent in English, French and
 Spanish. Visit drdirk.io to get to know me better.
